🛍️ FakeStore E-commerce Scraper & Frontend Clone
This project is a full-stack demonstration that scrapes real-time e-commerce data from FakeStoreAPI using Python, and displays it in a modern, responsive frontend UI. It features live product filtering, search, metadata summary, and category-based browsing — built for learning, demo, or portfolio purposes.

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This will create:

products_data.csv

ecommerce_data.json

2. View in Browser
Open index.html directly in your browser (no server needed):

bash
